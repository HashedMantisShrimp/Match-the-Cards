This is the git repository for a simple match up game.

The player enters his name and tries to find all matches in the least amount of moves and time possible. 

The cards are generated randomly on each start of the game and leaderboard players are sorted according to their score (from lowest to highest). The game currently has no sound and there is no posibiliy to save the game state of a player but I plan on implementing it in the coming days.

The "CameraShake" script is NOT mine and was acquired from: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Camera_Shake
